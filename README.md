# Algo Implementations

The idea of this is to learn more about data structures and algorithms by implementing them.

1. Create a blank template of all data structures and algorithms in https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src. It seems pretty comprehensive.
2. Write your own functional + TypeScript implementations of all of them (you can use tests from that library to validate them)
3. When you're happy with how it all went, make it an actual library and open source it
